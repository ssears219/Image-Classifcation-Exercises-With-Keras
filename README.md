# Image Classifcation Exercises With Keras

Using various neural networks and datasets for image classifications

## Description

Using section 5.1 in Deep Learning with Python as a guide, I create a ConvNet model that classifies images in the MNIST digit dataset. Next, using section 5.2 in Deep Learning with Python as a guide, I create a ConvNet model that classifies images CIFAR10 small images classification dataset. I do this twice; once without data augmentation or dropout, and again with. Finally, I use the ResNet50 model to classify various images.
